# DMCalculator
A lightweight (284 KB) java program to calculate and convert a bunch of stuff. You only need the .jar file to run the program. In case the .jar doesn't open, download the latest [Java SE Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

## Notepad
The program comes with a handy notepad at the right of the window which can be interchanged with 4 other notepads which hold their own information

## Formatting
If your answers aren't coming up as you wanted it is because they are being rounded. Go to the format tab and add as many # as you need to the text box and don't forget to click "Set Format"

#### Suffix
You can also set the program to automatically add a suffix upon calculation. Though do remember that inputs do not support suffixes, so only use numbers when calculating.

## Triangle
I wanted to include a short paragraph about the triangle tab since it is the most scary looking one. Simply feed it only the information you have about the triangle and click whatever you need to find. If it has enough information it will perform the calculation.
